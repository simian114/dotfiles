* sanam's emacs

This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration, focusing on modal editing with meow and a clean, efficient workflow.

** Features
- Modal editing using meow (vim-like keybindings with Emacs characteristics)
- Vim-surround style functionality through custom implementation
- Clean, minimalist UI with doom-modeline
- Efficient window and buffer management
- Git integration with Magit
- Org-mode configuration
- Project management with projectile
- Ivy/Counsel for completion

** Structure
- =sanam-init.el= - Main configuration file that loads all other modules
- =sanam-meow.el= - Modal editing configuration with meow
- =sanam-ui.el= - UI and theme settings
- =sanam-clipboard.el= - Clipboard functionality
- =sanam-projectile.el= - Project management configuration
- =sanam-window-management.el= - Window management functions
- =sanam-buffer-management.el= - Buffer navigation and organization
- =sanam-magit.el= - Git integration with Magit
- =sanam-org-mode.el= - Org-mode settings and functionality
- =sanam-surround.el= - Vim-surround style functionality for meow

The configuration uses a modular approach with a helper function to load configuration files regardless of where the repository is cloned, making it portable across different systems.

** Key Bindings
*** Modal Editing (meow)
Default meow key bindings with some customizations
- Normal mode accessed by ESC

*** Surround Functions
Available through two methods:
1. Leader key: =SPC y s=, =SPC y c=, =SPC y C=, =SPC y d=, =SPC y D=
2. Normal mode direct keys: =S=, =C=, =M-c=, =D=, =M-d=

** Prerequisites
- Fonts
  - JetBrains Mono - Primary coding font
  - Fira Code Retina - Secondary coding font with ligatures
  - Install these fonts before using this configuration for the best experience

- im-select
  - For automatic input mode change to English when exiting meow's insert mode
  - Required for proper modal editing with non-English input methods

** Installation
1. Clone this repository to your =~/.emacs.d= or =~/dotfiles/emacs= directory
2. Create symbolic links if necessary
3. Start Emacs using one of these methods:
   
   a. Using the provided script:
      #+begin_src shell
      ./runemacs.sh
      #+end_src
      
   b. Directly from command line:
      #+begin_src shell
      emacs -Q -l /path/to/sanam-init.el
      #+end_src
      
   c. By setting up your regular Emacs to load this configuration:
      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; Add to your default .emacs or init.el
      (load-file "/path/to/sanam-init.el")
      #+end_src

** Troubleshooting
- If icons appear as boxes or question marks, install nerd-fonts using the ~nerd-icons-install-fonts~ command
- If fonts are not rendering correctly, verify that both JetBrains Mono and Fira Code Retina are properly installed on your system
- For macOS users: Install fonts via Font Book application
- For Linux users: Place fonts in ~/.fonts directory and run fc-cache -fv

*** Forge Issues
- Forge should only be installed after Git remote configuration is properly set up
- If you encounter errors with Forge even after proper Git remote configuration:
  1. Remove the magit package from your Emacs package cache (~/.emacs.d/elpa/)
  2. Restart Emacs to force a clean reinstallation
  3. Verify your Git authentication is working correctly (SSH keys or credentials)
